# My Solutions to ProjectEuler 
> What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

## Notes
- each individual file should solve the corresponding problem directly or by taking the correct part of the printed solution
- all problems are designed in a way that it is possible to solve them in under a minute, nonetheless some of my solutions solve the problem just need more time. Probably a sign that I will revisit such a problem later.
- having solved a problem and already seeing a strategy how I could tackle the next problem my solutions aren't always optimized as far as the end. Again, probably a sign that I will revisit such a problem later.

Refering to the last two points, sometimes one or two days later a new better approach comes up and I rewrite my solution. Taking a look at Hackerranks ProjectEuler+ contest this is absolutely necessary. The guys at Hackerrank took original ProjectEuler problems and made them even harder to solve. Instead of your solution to the problem, you upload your code to their website and they run som testcases against it. If I'm not mistaken every testcase has a timeout after 2sec and some memory limit. Violate one of this restrictions and your code doesn't get a 100% score. So, good luck with these. :)
